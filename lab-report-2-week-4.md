- For this code, I added a comma followed by two angle brackets (<>).
- This caused the code to run in an infinite loop and not return anything.
- When compiled and run, nothing happens; code does not end unless you do command c to kill program.

- For this code, I added the string 'please break lol' right after the link.
- This caused the code to run in an infinite loop and not return anything.
- When compiled and run, nothing happens; code does not end unless you do command c to kill program.
